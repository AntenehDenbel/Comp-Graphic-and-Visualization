# 3D Scene Visualization Project

## Project Description
This repository contains a 3D scene visualization project developed using computational graphics techniques, likely implemented with a graphics library such as OpenGL or a Three.js equivalent in a programming environment like Python or JavaScript. The project features a fully realized 3D scene with models, dynamic lighting, textures, and interactive elements, built through iterative milestones including initial sketches, prototyping, refinement, and final polishing. The goal was to create an efficient and visually compelling scene while applying software design and development principles.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of computational graphics, software design, and program development by creating a functional 3D scene. Through this work, I explored modular design, iterative coding practices, and the application of computer science concepts to achieve both educational and professional growth. Below, I reflect on my approach to designing software, developing programs, and how computer science supports my long-term goals.

## Reflections on the Project

### How I Approach Designing Software
My approach to designing the software for this 3D scene centered on creating a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. This project helped me develop new skills in object-oriented design patterns, such as using classes to encapsulate scene objects, cameras, and renderers, which streamlined development and debugging. I followed a structured design process: starting with high-level requirements to define components like meshes, shaders, and user interactions, then creating wireframes and UML diagrams to map relationships, followed by prototyping and iterative integration. This approach allowed me to identify and resolve issues early, such as optimizing the rendering pipeline for complex geometries. In future projects, such as web applications or data visualization tools, I can apply similar tactics—like modular decomposition and agile design reviews—to enhance collaboration and reduce debugging time.

### How I Approach Developing Programs
Developing this 3D scene introduced me to new strategies, such as test-driven development (TDD) for critical functions like matrix transformations, ensuring reliable code from the start. Iteration was key, beginning with a basic wireframe model and progressively adding features like dynamic lighting and animations through cycles of coding, testing, and refinement based on visual output and performance metrics. Over the project’s milestones, my coding approach evolved from quick, ad-hoc scripts in early prototypes to a disciplined methodology incorporating Git for version control, branching for experiments, code reviews via pull requests, and profiling tools to address performance bottlenecks. This evolution culminated in a polished, efficient scene that performs well even on modest hardware, demonstrating the value of structured development practices.

### How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals
Working on computational graphics and visualizations has equipped me with valuable knowledge in rendering algorithms, such as ray tracing and GPU acceleration, which I can leverage in my educational pathway by pursuing advanced coursework in computer graphics or virtual reality. These skills enable me to tackle interdisciplinary projects, like simulating physical phenomena for physics or biology applications. Professionally, expertise in graphics opens opportunities in fields like game development, data analytics visualization, or augmented reality. For example, I could develop interactive dashboards for business intelligence or medical imaging tools, aligning with my goal of using technology to create innovative, impactful solutions to real-world challenges.
